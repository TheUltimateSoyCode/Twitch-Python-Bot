# Notes
To make the AI module work, you *may* use your OpenAI account, or just run a local API server. For instance using **[GPT4All.](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)** (Documentation you also can find there)

But just in case you want to use the local one the AI calculation *WILL* use your local hardware *VERY* hard to generate responses (ram and cpu (or gpu/ram/vram if you prefer gpu computing). Using models larger than 4 gb will also require more than 16 gb of ram (again in case of gpu computing, probably, will require more than 4-6 gb vram).

See OpenAI [API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create) for details
